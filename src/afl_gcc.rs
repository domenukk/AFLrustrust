   This program is a drop-in replacement for GCC or clang. The most common way
   of using it is to pass the path to afl-gcc or afl-clang via CC when invoking
   ./configure.

   (Of course, use CXX and point it to afl-g++ / afl-clang++ for C++ code.)

   The wrapper needs to know the path to afl-as (renamed to 'as'). The default
   is /usr/local/lib/afl/. A convenient way to specify alternative directories
   would be to set AFL_PATH.

   If AFL_HARDEN is set, the wrapper will compile the target app with various
   hardening options that may help detect memory management issues more
   reliably. You can also specify AFL_USE_ASAN to enable ASAN.

   If you want to call a non-default compiler as a next step of the chain,
   specify its location via AFL_CC or AFL_CXX.
