   A very simple tool that runs the targeted binary and displays
   the contents of the trace bitmap in a human-readable form. Useful in
   scripts to eliminate redundant inputs and perform other checks.

   Exit code is 2 if the target program crashes; 1 if it times out or
   there is a problem executing it; or 0 if execution is successful.
