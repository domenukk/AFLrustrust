   Ugh. There is an unintended compiler / glibc #include glitch caused by
   combining the u64 type an %llu in format strings, necessitating a workaround.

   In essence, the compiler is always looking for 'unsigned long long' for %llu.
   On 32-bit systems, the u64 type (aliased to uint64_t) is expanded to
   'unsigned long long' in <bits/types.h>, so everything checks out.

   But on 64-bit systems, it is #ifdef'ed in the same file as 'unsigned long'.
   Now, it only happens in circumstances where the type happens to have the
   expected bit width, *but* the compiler does not know that... and complains
   about 'unsigned long' being unsafe to pass to %llu.
